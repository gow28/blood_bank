Welcome to my "Blood Bank and Donor Management System project"!  
This project was designed to streamline the management of blood donors and their donations, making it easier for blood banks to track and organize donor information efficiently.

As a student passionate about using technology to improve healthcare, I built this system to demonstrate how software can help manage real    time data related to blood donations. It reflects my learning and practical skills in backend development and database management.
Features:

        Donor Registration: Donors can easily register by entering their details, making the process faster and more efficient.
        Donor List: View and manage the list of registered donors with a user    friendly interface.
        Database Storage: All donor information is securely stored in a MySQL database for easy retrieval.

Technologies  I Used:

        Frontend: HTML, CSS.
        Backend: PHP (to handle the logic behind donor registrations and data management)
        Database : MySQL (ensures that donor data is stored securely and can be easily accessed)

How to Access the Project:

Due to some deployment issues, I am unable to provide a live link for this project at the moment. However, you can still view the project details and run it on your local machine by following the steps below:

1.Download or Clone the Repository   : Get the project files by downloading them from this repository or by cloning it to your local machine.
   
2.Set Up MySQL Database   : You'll need a MySQL database to store donor information. Use XAMPP or another server solution, create a database, and follow the setup instructions included in the repository to get started.
   
3.Run Locally   : After setting up the database and updating the connection settings, you can access the system locally by running it on your server.
